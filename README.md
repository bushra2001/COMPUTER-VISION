# COMPUTER-VISION
Using MATLAB for Computer Vision and Image Processing

REQUIRED - MATLAB Resources
As a result of support from MathWorks, a  license to MATLAB is included for use with the course. 
You must have a computer capable of running MATLAB. Please check the system requirements: https://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq.html. 

Additionally, please note resources are available in the Course Resource section of the course. 
These resources are provided to assist you with the activities and assessments requiring you to use MATLAB.

They include:

1. Get MATLAB and

2. Learning MATLAB



In Computer Vision Matlab is used in:

1)Design vision solutions with a comprehensive set of reference-standard algorithms for image processing, computer vision, and deep learning.

2)Collaborate with teams using OpenCV, Python, and C/C++ using interoperable APIs and integration tools.

3)Use workflow apps to automate common tasks and accelerate algorithm exploration.

4)Accelerate algorithms on NVIDIA GPUs, cloud, and datacenter resources without specialized programming or IT knowledge.

5)Deploy algorithms to embedded devices, including NVIDIA GPUs, Intel processors and FPGAs, and ARM-based embedded processors.
